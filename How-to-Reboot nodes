########### Reboot nodes
Cordon the node so no further workloads are scheduled to run on it:

$kubectl cordon <node-name>

Drain the node of all current workloads:

$kubectl drain <node-name>

Shut down. Using the appropriate method for your provider, shut down the node.

Perform system maintenance or other task you need to do on the node and boot up the node.

Uncordon the node so that it can begin receiving workloads again.

$kubectl uncordon <node-name>
